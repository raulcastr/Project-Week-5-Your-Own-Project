## Project Description

Price analysis within ~1 Million airbnb accommodations and the local prices for the top 50 most visited cities around the world with the objective of finding the cheapest deals for tourists with lesser income and to find the cities where there is more economic dependence on tourism.

## Dataset

I used datasets from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html for each city AirBnB listings, and also I webscrapped wikipedia for the top 300 cities with higher GDP.

## Workflow

* Organize future steps with a kanbas board.
* Gathering and cleaning the data.
* Interpreting the data.
* Plotting and visualizations with Tableau. 
* Crafting a fun presentation and a medium article.

## Organization

I used a kanbas board (trello) to organize my work.

I divided the project in two folders, one folder for all the datasets and one for all the coding ( scraping, data cleaning, and ploting analysis ).
